Faceoff is a webapp optimized for mobile devices that helps you make decisions. It allows you to choose between many different options by focusing on two options at a time. It uses HTML5 localStorage and is based on [5KTODO](http://www.psychicorigami.com/2008/12/24/a-5k-javascript-local-storage-backed-todo-list-app/), with an icon from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:4-tournament.svg).
